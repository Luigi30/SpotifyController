SpotifyController
=================

Basic Spotify controller for Arduino Uno

The SpotifyController directory contains the Atmel Studio 6 project that must be written to the Arduino. This was made for use with the pinout of the Linksprite 16x2 LCD Keypad Shield but should work with any HD44780-compatible LCD as long as you configure the pins correctly.

avr.py is the controlling script that sends commands to the AVR. You'll need pywin32 installed to use it.

=================
Operation

The AVR's controller program implements a basic command set and support for controlling an HD44780. It waits for a serial connection (9600,8,N,1). Once one is established, the device resets and it is ready for commands.

The Python script finds a running Spotify window and sends commands to write the song and artist to the LCD when they change. If a line is too long, it will scroll one character every .5 seconds and reset at the end.

You can also pause by pressing the Select button on the shield. This will send a media pause keypress to Windows.

1. Load the SpotifyController solution onto the AVR.
2. Make sure Spotify is running.
3. Run avr.py.
4. Watch in amazement as the music title pops up on your LCD screen.
